This is a small spooky mathgame
ideally it will have 10 questions you must answer
if you get one wrong you lose a life lose all 3 lives 
    and you lose your chance to go trick-or-treating?

problems list by importance(top-to-bottom)

    center question
    create class for user to clean up code
    create graphics for lives(maybe some kind of pixel heart?)
    fix sprite(animation)
    sound effects for right and wrong answers
    add background music
    add 2nd frame
        after reaching 5 i want the window to scroll to the 2nd pane where #10 will be a little party / the gate for trick-or-treating
    code button at top-right to restart

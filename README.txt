This is a small spooky mathgame
ideally it will have 10 questions you must answer
if you get one wrong you lose a life lose all 3 lives 
    and you lose your chance to go trick-or-treating?

problems list by importance(top-to-bottom)

    create input box for answer to questions
    use game.py to randomize questions
    create class for user
    create graphics for lives(maybe some kind of pixel heart?)
    fix background(add progress markers)
    fix sprite(animation)
    sound effects for right and wrong answers
